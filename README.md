# Handwritten Digit Models
These are handwritten digits models that was made by me, collecting from various references around the internet as a media that i use for study machine learning.
# List
## Neural_handwritten_digit.model
1. Algorithm  : CNN
2. Epoch      : 5
3. Accuracy   : 0.9 (more or less from the last i evaluate it)
4. Data       : Mnist
5. Input      : (None,28)
## First Number Handwritten Model
1. Algorithm  : CNN
2. Epoch      : 3
3. Accuracy   : 0.7 (more or less from the last i evaluate it)
4. Data       : Mnist
5. Input      : (None,784)
# How to use
You can use it via the load_model function in keras, the input must be resize or has the size of the input required above.
